####This is a website for address book application written in cSharp
####By: Neil Larion

## Description

###This is a project that allows the user to store contact information for people they know. The point of this project is to show a list of contacts at the root path, use a form to create a new contact, and a button to clear contacts. It also meets the following criteria:
* Contact Object has a cconstructor.
* Appropriate view files with RESTful reoutes.
* The first page of the app at the root path displays links to two pages: one page for a user to view the properties of any existing Contact objects, and one page presenting the user with a form they can fill out to create a new Contact.
* Ability to get/delete all existing Contact ojects.
* On form submission the new Contact Object is saved to a static list

This project was developed during a "Code Review" session at Epicodus, which is a solo project designed to test our knowledge of the materials learned over the previous week's study. It's an honor to be apart of a coding community where people are genuinely interested in what they're doing. A link to the live site is provided below:
